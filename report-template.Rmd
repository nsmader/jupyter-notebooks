## Safety by Neighborhood Violence

My organization is `r org`. My programs are `r paste(subset(df, org == org)$program, collapse = ", ")`.

```{r figure}
head(subset(df, org == org))
```

## Maps

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r map}
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lat = runif(n = 1, min = 41, max = 42), lng = runif(n = 1, min = -88, max = -86))
```

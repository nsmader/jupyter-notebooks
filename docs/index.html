<h1>R Tutorials Page</h1>
<h2>Nick Mader (nsmader@gmail.com)</h2>

This is a simple index page with links to a handful of tutorials for R that I have created:

<ul>
  <li><a href = "reference-for-data-table-functionality.html">Reference for data.table</a>
  <li><a href = "demo-of-leaflet-in-R.html">Demo of Leaflet.</a>
  <li><a href = "cleaning-data-with-R.html">Cleaning Data with R (in active construction)</a>
</ul>
